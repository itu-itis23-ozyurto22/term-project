        <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
        <p>
            My academic interests is mostly focused on automotive software technologies such as engine (ECU Chip), brake systems (ABS), stabilization systems (TCS/DSC),Self-Driving cars and so.
            Those systems are mostly coded with C,C++ and sometimes Scala/Python.It would be benefiicial for humanity to make an improvement on these systems so people can travel much more safe.
